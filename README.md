# FinVault

Centralised financial record, hosted on-prem. 

The public website and GitHub Pages publishing instructions are in [docs/](docs/README.md).

## Local testing

Run these commands from the repository root. Install dependencies first:

```bash
uv sync --locked
```

Run Gmail ingestion and transaction processing (`src/finvault/__main__.py`).
Place your Google OAuth `credentials.json` in the repository root; the first run
opens a browser for authorization and saves `token.json`.

```bash
uv run --locked python -m finvault
```

Start the UI server (`src/finvault/api/main.py`):

```bash
uv run --locked uvicorn finvault.api.main:app --reload
```

Open <http://127.0.0.1:8000/>. Both commands use `data/finvault.db`.
